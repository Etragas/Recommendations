The env is meant to run in python 3.6.*
To run the code, make sure you have a 3.6 installation running (use virtualenv if necessary)
Then, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies.
Then install pytorch for python 3.6.1
If everything is working, you should be able to run 
`python src/main.py`
